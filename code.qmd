# Code 

## Google Earth Engine
The scripts that we used to generate LandTrendr outputs are heavily based on the [eMapR API](https://emapr.github.io/LT-GEE/api.html). They are also available in the [git hub repo](https://github.com/cafri-labs/lt_for_femc/tree/main/scripts) for this document.

  - [change map outpus](https://github.com/cafri-labs/lt_for_femc/blob/main/scripts/change_map.js)
  
  - [ftv and vertex outputs](https://github.com/cafri-labs/lt_for_femc/blob/main/scripts/vertex_ftv.js)
  
  
  
## Accuracy Assesment
  We have also included in that [git hub repo](https://github.com/cafri-labs/lt_for_femc/tree/main/scripts) several scripts that we used to process and assess the LandTrendr outputs for our [tuning work](tuning.qmd). 
  
  - [Initial tuning](https://github.com/cafri-labs/lt_for_femc/blob/main/scripts/single_disturbance_accuracy_assesment.R)
  
  - [Secondary tuning](https://github.com/cafri-labs/lt_for_femc/blob/main/scripts/multi_disturbance_accuracy_assesment.R) -  this script requires outputs from both [this](https://github.com/cafri-labs/lt_for_femc/blob/main/scripts/create_loss_layer.R) (processes the ftv outputs) and [this](https://github.com/cafri-labs/lt_for_femc/blob/main/scripts/harvest_brick.R) (rasterizes reference data)
