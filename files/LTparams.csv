Parameter,Description,Default
spike threshold,Sets the size of abrupt deviation in spectral value that is considered a spike. Smaller values filter out spikes more aggressively,0.9
p-value threshold,The p-value threshold for trajectory selection. Trajectories with p-values that exceed this threshold are considered no change. ,0.05
max segments,The maximum number of segments allowed in trajectory fitting,
vertex count overshoot,Initial regression-based detection of potential vertices can overshoot the number of vertices allowed by max segments by this value; angle-based culling is used to return to the desired number of vertices if overshoot occurs. This allows for a mix of criteria for vertex identification.,3
recovery threshold,Disallows candidate segment that have a recovery rate faster than 1/recovery threshold (in years).,0.25
prevent one year recovery,"Disallows all segments with recovery rates equal to one year, either true or false. ",FALSE
best model proportion,Allows models with more vertices than allowed by max segments to be chosen if their p-value is no more than (2 – best model proportion) times the p-value of the best model.,0.75
minimum observations needed,Minimum number of cloud free images needed to perform fitting.,6
delta,Change type to map – either loss (disturbance) or gain (recovery/growth). ,loss*
sort,"The type of change to identify if there is more than one change event in the pixel of interest – one of greatest, least, newest, oldest, fastest, slowest.",greatest*
magnitude,Either a minimum or maximum value for filtering change events by change in spectral reflectance value; filtering is not required.,> 50*
duration,Either a minimum or maximum value for filtering change events by length of event. Filtering by disturbance duration is not required.,< 4*
preval,Either a minimum or maximum value for filtering change events by the pre-change value of the spectral index. Filtering by preval is not required.,> 300*
minimum mapping unit (mmu),Indicates the smallest allowable disturbance patch. Pixels disturbed in the same year and adjacent following an 8-neightbor rule are considered to be of the same patch. Filtering by mmu is not required.,7*
